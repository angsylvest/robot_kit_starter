# robot_kit_starter
Starter code for Raspberry Pi 4 - based robotics kit. The parts used include an IMU (Adafruit 9-DOF Absolute Orientation IMU Fusion Breakout - BNO055), motors (Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver), and an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) using a standard chassis as the base. This borrows the initial set-up code and adds additional starter code for ease of use for those interested in replicating this work.
